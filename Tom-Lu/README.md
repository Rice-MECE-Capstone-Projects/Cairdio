# ENABLE FreeRTOS & UART and CONFIGURE On-Board DDR RAM with FreeRTOS

This repository showcases the setup and configuration of FreeRTOS, a real-time operating system, on the FPGA platform. The setup includes configuring UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) for serial communication, which forms the foundation for managing multiple tasks and enhancing debugging capabilities. Additionally, it involves configuring the on-board DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM within the FreeRTOS environment to enable the system to record and store large volumes of data, such as audio inputs from PDM microphones, in DDR RAM.

## Implementation

A basic setting for my FPGA choice ARTY S7-50 can be seen [here](https://community.element14.com/technologies/fpga-group/b/blog/posts/arty-s7-50-first-baremetal-software-project).

By following this guide, you can set up 

## Hardware/Software setting
